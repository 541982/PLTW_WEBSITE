<p>I was born and raised in bakersfield.I used to live with my grandma till i was about 5 1/2 years old because i was a very sick child and my parents always work.</p>
<p>I was always a pretty happy kid, i have always been very close with my uncle Justin.</p>
<p>I have 3 older sisters and 1 little brother. I also have a nephew named Amor he is the cutest and I get to see him every weekend and sometimes during the week.</p>
<P>One time when I was about 2 or 3 i had a allergic reaction to the combination shot to prevent the chicken pocks, I had a seizure and my eyes rolled to the back of my head and I was in the hospital for about 3 days and iwas in so much pain the medcine was noy working for the pain.</P>
<p>My sister diamond and I are like best friends we have always been close and my parents have pretty much raised twins because we love to match and loved do things together.</p>
<p>My first boyfriend was one that would always come over to my grandma's house and it was easy to be able to date because even when I moved back to my parent's house very weekend I would still go over to my grandma's house so even when I went to school I could still see my boyfriend.</p>
<p>My little brother would always play with my boo because I was older so I would be hanging out with my boo's sister cause she was 12 years old. </p>
<body>My nephew will always be my very first love he has a very special place in my heart he's my baby like there will never be a time where anyone can take his place. </body>
